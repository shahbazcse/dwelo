        "title": "Veluvana Bali - Owl Bamboo House",
        "description": "\nVeluvana is a unique bamboo house with a wonderful view of Sidemen Valley, a genuine tropical landscape with Mount Agung peak on its back. This getaway spot is a great place to bring into reality the dream adventure of the true wanderer. We invite you to feel the magnificent vibes of the entire house to escape the life that is full of drama into a journey with ultimate joy.\nThe space\nThe bamboo house is located at the main tourist district of Sidemen, a small town with a magnificent landscape in the southern flank of Mount Agung. Sidemen is not a touristy area, it is about a 90-minute drive from Bali Airport and a 45-minute drive from Ubud. Besides the beautiful scenery and the indigenous culture Sidemen also surrounded by a lot of famous tourist destinations in Bali. Some of them include; Lempuyang Temple (The Gateway to Heaven), Besakih (The Mother Temple of Bali), Tirta Gangga Royal Water Palace, Telaga Waja River for Rafting, Amed Diving Spot, and Bias Putih the Virgin Beach.\n\nUpon arrival at Veluvana bamboo house, you will find the upper ground parking area with a small gazebo on the west side of the entrance and a small front office building in the north-east edge. Take your time in the upper ground to enjoy the welcome drink served by our doorman while resting from a long journey through the wavy road of East Bali.\n\nOnce you finish your drink, the declining stairs down to the north edge of the upper ground will lead you to the bamboo house. You will not see the building until you reach the lower ground as it is secluded behind the bamboo wall and vegetation. At the lower ground, you will notice a small fish pond to be your silent neighbor during your stay. Spin the leaf door and follow the stone path to head into the ground level of the bamboo house.\nAll part of the building is fully designed for guest enjoyment. Sit back the bamboo couch to watch the painting-like scenery right from the ground level porch. On the left side of the house is a small pool to chill with your partner. While at the right end are the semi-open toilet and the lush rain-forest shower. There is also a kitchenette at the back of the couch that features a sink, a cooler, a coffee maker, a water heater, and seasonal fruit will also be served subject to availability.\n\nClimb up to the upper level of the house through the bamboo stairs, you will enter the all bamboo bedroom that facing north to the Sidemen Valley with the green hills and Mount Agung on its back. Half of the room wall is windows with transparent glass that allows sunrise to light up your mind and sunset to color up your soul. The room features a comfort double-sized bed, a single reclining sofa bed, and a cozy bedroom chair where you can kick back and relax with a book or hustling on a laptop before rolling into bed.\n\nThe upper level of the house also features a balcony on the east side and the dreamy hanging net right in front of your bed. Carefully spin the east door to enjoy sightseeing from the east balcony especially when the sunlight softly appears to charm you up from your restful sleep. If you brave enough to try relaxing on the hanging net while enjoying the magnificent view of Mount Agung, open the north side window and go down slowly to the net. Layback and chill like you were floating on a soft cloud. It is okay to also bring pillows and blanket to the net because anyone can fall asleep by the soft wind of the Sidemen Valley.\nOther things to note\nBEFORE YOU BOOK, PLEASE READ A FEW DETAILS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION:\n\n1. The Construction\nThe construction and furniture are mostly made of locally-sourced bamboo that covered with rice straw roofs. The building is designed and built by local bamboo artisans with serious consideration to the strength of the entire part of the construction and furniture. The lower level floor is a half meter from the ground with a higher edge on the north porch; please take care of your step while playing on this site. The upper level is 2.5 meters from the ground with stairs that are considered easy to climb; watch your head and hold the railing for your safety.\n\n2. Water, Electricity, and Wi-Fi\nThe water you use in this house is supplied by the regional water company that distributes fresh water sourced from Mount Agung aquifer. Although the water is fresh, it is not ready to drink water, so please drink only water that is served in the bottle and ask the doormen to refill if it runs out. The electricity installed in the house is connected with the main east Bali grid system to assure you have reliable lighting in the night and optimum power supply to your device. Because we understand you may physically off-grid, but your digital presence can have no break. So, Wi-Fi is free as always.\n\n3. The Location\nThe small town of Sidemen is less crowded compare to Ubud and any other tourist destination in Bali. This area is slowly growing as the indigenous culture and society remain preserved by its humility. You can explore the village in a short-range by foot, a scooter is also available to rent if you want to go a little bit further to the town center or the neighbor village.\n\n4. Public Facility\nThe small town of Sidemen has a village hall, traditional market, small grocery, school, and hospital with an emergency care unit. Ride a scooter around 5 – 10 minutes from the bamboo house to reach one of these facilities. Bigger public facilities are available in the nearest town of Semarapura that requires a 20-minute drive or Denpasar that is around 60 minutes from Sidemen.\n\n5. The Climate\nThe climate is divided into two seasons, dry or wet. The dry season comes around May – September while the wet season is from October – April each year. However, climate change has made the weather a bit unpredictable. Sometimes there is a rainy day within the dry season, and not all day is rainy during the wet season. When you stay during the wet season please consider facing heavy rain with a wind that may blow water into the lower ground porch, the upper balcony, and the hanging net. However, we have installed curtains and roll-up blinds at the lower ground so you can protect yourself from rainwater or bugs in the night.\n\n6. The Bugs\nThe bamboo house is located within a rice terrace with rich biodiversity. Our commitment to reducing the carbon footprint has led us to design the house with minimum impact on the surrounding living organism. Stay in this bamboo house means that you are willing to share your living space with other creatures. Ants, fly, mosquito, and other insects are commonly found outside of the building especially during fruit season. As long as you keep the space clean and not leave any left food open, they will not come to disturb you. If you notice mosquito entering the bedroom area, we highly recommend you to use the mosquito net on the bed during your sleep. If you have a specific insect allergy or afraid of these insects, we suggest this bamboo house is not good for you. Or you may go at your own risk.\n\n7. Room Services\nYou have a doormen stand-by at 7.00 am – 9.00 pm at the upper ground, you can ask him almost anything you need to make your stay enjoyable. He will help you with breakfast, food for lunch and dinner, find a masseur, room cleaning, laundry, transportation, area information, and tourist activities. You can also contact us online through Airbnb platform in case the onsite services do not meet your needs.\n\n8. Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner\nBreakfast for two is included in your booking. You can ask the doormen to serve the breakfast in the spot you want. Whether it is floating on the pool (additional charge), on the couch or you feel too heavy to wake up from your bed, the breakfast will be served at your convenience. We plan to have a small restaurant in the upper ground so that you can order food for your lunch as well as dinner with additional charge.\n\n9. Air Conditioning\nWe do not install air conditioning in the house as it is against our spirit to maintain natural air remain fresh and healthy. Matter-fact we think we do not need that urban stuff around Sidemen Village, especially when you let the soft natural wind flows into your space.\n\n10. Use of Hanging Net\nThe hanging net is made of strong string with iron steel pillars to sustain the weight of the user. Using the hanging net means you understand the risk that you may fell off to the side of the net if you are not careful. Only use the hanging net if you are confident that you have a good balance and always have your partner watching you in case you need help to get back to the room. Do not use the hanging net after hitting even a shoot of alcohol. Do not jump down from the hanging net and do not hang on it as it is your pull up bar.\n\n11. The Neighborhood\nAs the bamboo house is located in the main tourist district of Sidemen, several accommodations and restaurants are situated near your space. You will see some buildings on the west side of the house. Right at the back of the house is also accommodation with several rooms. The neighbor is warm and friendly, especially the owner of the surrounding properties. However, to make sure you have great privacy during your stay, we have created a high bamboo fence at the back of the house and plant dense vegetation on each border with the neighbor property.\n\n12. Irresponsible Behavior\nIrresponsible behavior and threatening and abusive conduct towards the host, doormen, neighbors of the house, and the villager will not be tolerated. The host will refuse to allow check-in to the house if there is any case and or information that assume the guest (s) have related to any irresponsible behavior, threatening, and abusive conduct toward the mentioned person above. The host also has a full authority to end guest stay in the house if there is any case and or information that assume the guest (s) have related to any irresponsible behavior, threatening, and abusive conduct toward the mentioned person above. No refund will be given regarding the cancelation/canceled stay due to irresponsible behavior, threatening, and abusive conduct toward the mentioned person above.\nThe host will not have a further responsibility to the guest once the booking is canceled and or the stay is ended.",

        "description": "The sound of the Kalsa is a constant companion during your stay in our unique Dome Tents at the Glamping Tales Campsite. Morning walks exploring nearby trails, lazy afternoons by the riverside and evenings spent swapping stories at the fire pit make for a regular day here with furry and feathered friends over for company. Located 15km from Bhimtal, at a tiny village Tada, it is a 45min drive with the last 5km in poor condition. We are a small camp with 5 tents pitched in a natural landscape.\nThe space\nOur camp is a small oasis surrounded by nature. We have the river flowing by and forest on 3 sides. We have operational local farms in the village adjacent to us and guests can experience farm activities as well. We have 2 Geodesic Dome Tents and 3 Swiss Cottage Tents fairly secluded from one another and we have a small cafe where we prepare fresh wholesome meals for our guests. Overall a space to relax and unwind away from city life.\nGuest access\nGuests can access the open sit out spaces, the cafe and the fire pit areas.\nOther things to note\nThe last 5km of road to the camp is in poor condition. We suggest guests avoid vehicles with very low ground clearance.\nThe camp is approx a 150mtr walk down a rough path from the road where the vehicle will need to be parked. We request guests to carry shoes since the area is quite rocky being a riverside location.",
